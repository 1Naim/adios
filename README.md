# The Adaptive Deadline I/O Scheduler
Based on mq-deadline and Kyber,  
with learning-based adaptive latency control  
Concept Preview / Early Prototype

## To-do list:
- latency-capped multi-class batching
- latency-based dispatch throttling
- latency-capped merging limitation
- statistically more accurate curve finding
- anomaly exclusion
- improved temporal tracking of performance
- configurability
- debug outputs
- better scalability
